## How to play:
1. Run the application in a console.
2. Follow the on-screen or readme.md instructions to choose your difficulty
3. Wait till the program print out "Fire" and click spacebar as fast as you can so you dont get shot
4. Have fun!
## Input-Output:
* Select the difficulty you want to try from the following: 1 (Easy), 2 (Medium), 3 (Hard), 4 (Harder)
* Use the Spacebar to fire your gun!

The program will tell you wether you fired fast enough

After the game has ended:
