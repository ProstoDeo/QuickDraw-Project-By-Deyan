This is a simple console based implementation of the game "**GunBlood**" called **Quick-Draw** written in C#.

## Live Demo:

## How to play:
1. Run the application in a console.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose your move
3. Have fun!
## Input-Output:
* Select the difficulty you want to try from the following: 1 (Easy), 2 (Medium), 3 (Hard), 4 (Harder)

The program will tell you wether you fired fast enough
